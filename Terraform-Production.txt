ðŸ”‘ Key Terraform Features in Real-World Node.js Projects (MNC Use Cases)
  
  1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
      Entire infra (servers, DBs, load balancers, VPCs, Kubernetes clusters) is described in .tf files.
      Version-controlled in Git â†’ review via PRs, audit trail.
      Ensures consistency across Dev/QA/Staging/Prod.

  2. Providers
      Terraform connects to cloud providers & tools:
        AWS (EKS, ECS, RDS, S3, ALB)
        GCP (GKE, Cloud SQL, Storage)
        Azure (AKS, CosmosDB, Blob)
        Kubernetes, Helm, Vault, Datadog, GitHub, etc.
      MNCs use multiple providers for hybrid / multi-cloud strategies.


  3. State Management
      Keeps track of infra in a state file (terraform.tfstate).
      Remote state in S3 + DynamoDB (AWS), GCS (GCP), Azure Blob, with locking.
      Ensures teams donâ€™t overwrite each otherâ€™s infra changes.

  4. Execution Plan (Plan & Apply)
      terraform plan â†’ preview what will change.
      terraform apply â†’ make the change.
      Safe workflows for infra changes in MNCs with approvals in CI/CD.

  5. Modules (Reusable Components)
      Packaged templates for common infra:
        VPC, EKS cluster, RDS DB, Node.js app on ECS/EKS, monitoring stack.
      Promotes DRY principles & standardization across teams.

  6. Variables & Outputs
      Variables â†’ parameterize infra (region, instance size, scaling limits).
      Outputs â†’ expose info (DB endpoint, ALB URL, K8s config).
      Used in pipelines to pass infra outputs to application deploys.

  7. Workspaces (Multi-Environment)
      Separate dev, staging, prod within same codebase.
      Prevents accidental cross-env changes.
      Widely used in MNCs for multi-team, multi-env projects.

  8. Provisioners (with Caution)
      Run scripts (shell, Ansible, etc.) after resource creation.
      Example: Configure Node.js app logs after VM creation.
      In production, MNCs prefer immutable infra (AMI, Docker images) over provisioners.

  9. Integration with CI/CD
      Pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps):
        terraform validate â†’ check syntax
        terraform plan â†’ approval
        terraform apply â†’ apply changes
      MNCs enforce manual approvals for prod.

  10. Resource Graph & Dependencies
      Terraform builds a dependency graph.
      Example: Node.js service â†’ depends on RDS DB â†’ depends on VPC.
      Ensures infra comes up in the correct order.

  11. Drift Detection
      Detects if infra was changed outside Terraform (manual console changes).
      Prevents config drift between teams.

  12. Scaling & Autoscaling
      Define ASGs (Auto Scaling Groups), ECS services, or EKS node pools.
      Connects with Prometheus/Kubernetes HPA for Node.js workload scaling.
  
  13. Secrets & Sensitive Data
      Works with Vault, SSM Parameter Store, Secrets Manager.
      Prevents hardcoding API keys or DB passwords.

  14. Policy as Code (Compliance)
      Enforce rules using Sentinel or OPA (e.g., no public S3 buckets, enforce tagging).
      MNCs use this for governance & security compliance.

  15. Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Deployments
      Same codebase can deploy Node.js apps to AWS, GCP, Azure.
      Some MNCs deploy across clouds for redundancy & cost optimization.
