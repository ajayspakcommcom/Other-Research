ðŸ”‘ Key Kubernetes Features in Real-World Node.js Projects

  1. Pods & Deployments
      Pods: Smallest unit, runs Node.js container(s).
      Deployments: Manage rolling updates, rollbacks, scaling of Pods.
      Used for stateless Node.js APIs, GraphQL services, background workers.


  2. ReplicaSets & Autoscaling
      ReplicaSets keep a fixed number of Pods running.
      Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): scales based on CPU/memory/Prometheus metrics.
      Cluster Autoscaler: spins up/down nodes in cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).
      Critical for Node.js APIs that need to handle sudden traffic spikes.


  3. Services
      ClusterIP: Internal service-to-service communication.
      NodePort: Exposes for debugging.
      LoadBalancer: Exposes Node.js API to internet via cloud LB (ALB, ELB, NLB, GCLB).
      Enables Node.js apps to talk to databases, Redis, and other microservices.

  4. Ingress & API Gateway
      Ingress Controller (NGINX, Traefik, Istio Gateway) for routing, TLS termination, path-based routing.
      Node.js microservices often sit behind Ingress for /api, /auth, /users.
      Supports rate limiting, request size, and security headers.

  5. ConfigMaps & Secrets
      ConfigMaps: Store environment configs (DB_URL, REDIS_HOST).
      Secrets: Store sensitive values (JWT_SECRET, API_KEYS).
      Mounted as env variables or volumes.
      Ensures Node.js apps follow 12-factor app practices.

  6. Persistent Volumes (PV) & Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
      For Node.js apps that need storage (e.g., logs, uploads, cache).
      Backed by cloud storage: EBS (AWS), GCE PD (GCP), Azure Disk.
        Example: File upload service in Node.js storing images.

  7. Namespaces
      Separate environments: dev, qa, staging, prod.
      MNCs isolate microservices per namespace for RBAC & resource limits.

  8. Resource Requests & Limits
      Define CPU/memory requests & limits in Pod spec.
      Protects cluster from a Node.js app consuming all resources (memory leaks, runaway processes).

  9. Probes (Liveness, Readiness, Startup)
      Liveness probe: Restarts Node.js Pod if it hangs.
      Readiness probe: Ensures Pod only gets traffic when ready (important for cold starts).
      Startup probe: Handles slow-boot Node.js apps.

  10. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
      Controls who can deploy, scale, or delete resources.
      MNCs integrate with LDAP/SSO for developer access.

  11. DaemonSets
      Run system-level agents on every node (logging, monitoring, security).
        Example: Fluentd, Datadog agents, Istio sidecars.

  12. Jobs & CronJobs
      Jobs: One-time tasks (DB migrations, cache warmup).
      CronJobs: Scheduled tasks (clear sessions, send emails, nightly ETL).
      Node.js workers often run in CronJobs for background processing.

  13. Service Mesh (Istio / Linkerd)
      Traffic routing, retries, circuit breaking for Node.js microservices.
      mTLS for zero-trust security between services.
      Fine-grained observability (tracing, metrics).

  14. Logging & Monitoring
      Logs: Shipped via Fluentd/EFK, Datadog, Splunk.
      Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana dashboards.
      Tracing: Jaeger / OpenTelemetry to track Node.js request chains.

  15. Network Policies
      Restrict traffic between Pods (e.g., only allow Node.js app â†’ Redis).
      Reduces blast radius in case of compromise.

  16. Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs)
      Ensures a minimum number of Node.js Pods stay alive during upgrades/maintenance.

  17. Horizontal & Vertical Scaling
      HPA: Adds/removes Pods.
      VPA: Adjusts CPU/memory requests automatically.
      Used in MNC projects where Node.js traffic is highly variable.

  18. CI/CD Integration
      GitHub Actions / Jenkins / GitLab CI builds Docker image â†’ pushes to registry â†’ deploys with kubectl or Helm.
      Canary / Blue-Green deployments via Ingress or Service Mesh.

  19. Helm & Kustomize
      Helm: Package Node.js services into reusable charts.
      Kustomize: Overlay configs per environment (dev vs prod).
      Both widely used in MNCs for managing complex deployments.

  20. Cluster Security & Policies
      Pod Security Standards (PSS) / OPA / Kyverno to enforce security rules.
        Example: Block Node.js Pods from running as root.
