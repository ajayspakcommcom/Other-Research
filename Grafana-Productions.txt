ðŸ”‘ Key Grafana Features Used in Real Node.js Projects (MNC Use Cases)

  1. Dashboards & Visualization
      Build interactive dashboards for Node.js metrics (requests, latency, CPU, memory, event loop lag).
      Combine metrics from Prometheus, Loki, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, CloudWatch, Datadog.
      Common panels:
        Request throughput (RPS)
        p95/p99 latency
        Error rates (4xx, 5xx)
        CPU / Memory per pod
        GC pauses, event loop delay

2. Data Source Integrations
      Connects to multiple backends:
      Prometheus â†’ app/infrastructure metrics
        Loki / ELK â†’ logs
        Tempo / Jaeger â†’ traces
        MySQL/Postgres â†’ business KPIs
      MNCs use Grafana as a single pane of glass for app + infra + business metrics.


3. Alerting & Notifications
      Alerts configured directly in Grafana or via Prometheus Alertmanager.
      Notifications sent to:
        Slack, MS Teams, Email, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Webhooks
      Typical Node.js alerts:
        Latency > 1s for 5m
        Error rate > 5%
        Memory > 80%

4. Annotations
      Overlay deployments, incidents, feature flags on dashboards.
      Helps correlate spikes in errors/latency with code releases or infra changes.

5. Templating & Variables
      Dynamic dashboards with filters (service, environment, cluster, region).
      Example: Select app=node-api, env=prod â†’ auto-refresh panels.
      Used in MNCs where hundreds of Node.js microservices exist.

6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
      Different teams get different access:
        Devs â†’ read-only dashboards.
        SREs â†’ edit dashboards.
        Managers â†’ business KPIs.
      Integrates with SSO/LDAP/OAuth for enterprise security.

7. Provisioning & Infrastructure-as-Code
    Dashboards, alerts, and datasources defined in YAML/JSON.
    Managed via GitOps (version-controlled in Git, deployed via CI/CD).
    MNCs treat Grafana configs like code for consistency across environments.

8. Explore Mode (Logs + Metrics Correlation)
    Debugging flow:
      Check latency spike â†’ drill into logs â†’ check traces.
    Very powerful for Node.js incident response (SRE on-call).

9. Alert Rules with Unified Alerting
    Supports Prometheus-style rules.
    Example:
      rate(http_requests_total{job="node-api",status=~"5.."}[5m]) 
        / rate(http_requests_total{job="node-api"}[5m]) > 0.05
    â†’ Fires alert if error ratio > 5%.

10. Dashboards for Business + App Metrics
    Not just infra: teams visualize business KPIs.
    Example (Node.js e-commerce app):
      Orders per minute
      Payment failures
      Active users

11. Plugin Ecosystem
    Panels (heatmaps, geomaps, pie charts).
    Data sources (Splunk, New Relic, Snowflake, Cloud providers).
    Used in large enterprises for cross-tool integration.

12. Long-Term Observability
    With Grafana Mimir / Thanos / Cortex for metrics retention.
    With Grafana Loki for logs.
    With Grafana Tempo for distributed traces.\
    Enables full observability stack for Node.js projects.
