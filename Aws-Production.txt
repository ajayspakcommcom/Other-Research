      Secrets Manager / Parameter Store: Secure storage for app secrets.
      Shield & WAF: DDoS protection, firewall for web traffic.
      GuardDuty & Macie: Threat detection and sensitive data monitoring.

  6. Monitoring & Logging
      CloudWatch: Metrics, alarms, log aggregation.
      X-Ray: Distributed tracing for microservices.
      CloudTrail: API audit logs for compliance.
      OpenTelemetry + Prometheus/Grafana integrations.

  7. DevOps & CI/CD
      CodePipeline / CodeBuild / CodeDeploy: AWS-native CI/CD pipelines.
      ECR (Elastic Container Registry): Private Docker image registry.
      Integrated with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI for deployments.

  8. Scalability & High Availability
      Auto Scaling Groups: Horizontal scaling of EC2/ECS/EKS.
      Elastic Load Balancers (ALB, NLB, GLB): Distribute traffic across services.
      Multi-AZ Deployments: Database & app redundancy.
      Multi-Region Deployments: Global failover for critical apps.
